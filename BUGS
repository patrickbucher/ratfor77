This is not a bug but a design error
in both AT&T ratfor
and this public domain ratfor:

The problem is with the switch statment.
It switches on an integer valued expression.
It should switch on an integer variable.

The reason is that
	"implicit undefined"
	"implicit null"
is unusable because the switch is done
on a new variable that is not declared or declarable
by the programmer who cannot guess its name.

Please let me know if you fix this.
